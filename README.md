This project is designed as a comprehensive learning tool for understanding and mastering the core concepts of the Spring Framework.
It contains two main packages: springcore and springjdbc, each encompassing various sub-packages that implement essential features of the Spring Core and Spring JDBC modules.

springcore

Dependency Injection: Demonstrates the different types of dependency injection (constructor, setter, and field injection) provided by Spring.
IOC container:Demonstrate how IOC container works.
Lifecycle Methods: Shows the lifecycle of Spring beans, including initialization and destruction callbacks.
Spring Expression Language (SpEL): Implements examples of SpEL for injecting values into Spring beans.
Injection of Collection Data Types: Examples of injecting collections (List, Set, Map) into Spring beans.
Annotation bases configuration.


springjdbc

Database Connection: Manages connections to the database using Spring JDBC.
Database Operations: Contains implementations of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Spring JDBC templates.

Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to provide hands-on examples and a deeper understanding of various Spring Framework concepts, particularly focusing on:
Spring Core: Learning the foundational elements of Spring such as dependency injection, bean lifecycle, and expression language.
Spring JDBC: Understanding how to interact with databases using Spring's JDBC module, including setting up connections and performing database operations.
